Exploratory Factor Analysis in R
In this analysis, I perform basic data exploration to determine the factor structure of the data.
I use the Norwegian student survey data that was obtained from the Norwegian Agency for Shared Services in Education and Research (SIKT).
I answer the question: What empirical structure of the SSRLO is revealed when the data is viewed across the respondents of the 2018 cycle of the student survey?
based on the cumulative variance, RMSEA  and the factor loadings pattern, the analysis revealed that a two-factor model fit the data best.
